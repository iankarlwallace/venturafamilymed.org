Docker install as follows:

Install repo and load rpms via these instructions:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/

Follow post install setup:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Install docker-compose:
dnf install docker-compose

Then you want to install the Joomla/MariaDB Docker Base
(see the docker-compose.yml file for a start)

docker-compose up (for the first run to see if errors)
Two Ctrl-C's to stop them
Then in the future run docker-compose up -d

The Joomla files will live in:
/var/lib/docker/volumes/venturafamilymedorg_joomla_data/_data/joomla

Which is owned by bin:bin ... more on how to load an image from GoDaddy here for testing
It would be nice if it was owned by the local user and writtable by the server (Apache)
But maybe a depolyment script could be used after some testing
